# Death Note
_"The human whose name is written in this note shall die."_

## About
Take careful notice of the first rule of the Death Note, as a person's life can end in a matter of seconds. Death Note is a popular Japanese anime created by Tsugumi Ohba, in which a mysterious notebook holds the power to kill anyone in the world, simply by writing down a person's name. This plugin brings the infamous notebook to Minecraft, placing its incredible power to kill in the palm of your hand.

## How to Use
To use the Death Note, simply type the username of any online player on the first page of the notebook. Then, as according to the rules of the Death Note, that player will die within 40 seconds unless they are exempted.

Once a player's life has been taken by a Death Note, their username will be added to the note's list of victims. If you plan on having a run-in with L, Near, or any members of the Task Force, you'll need to take this into consideration.

There are a few limitations to using the Death Note, such as the inability to sign the book. As such, it can always be edited and can always be used - unless it is destroyed. Be sure not to die while in possession of the notebook as well, as the Death Note will be dropped alongside your other items and can be used by whoever picks it up.
